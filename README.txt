Installation instructions:

Copy template-dashboard-clean.html to solution/system/pentaho-cdf/ and place CST dir right
under solutions dir


Then point pentaho to open this at user login by hand editing (sorry, no way around this) the
MantleSettings.properties file that exists inside mantle-<version>.jar in pentaho server web-inf directory.


For instance:
pentaho-server/webapps/pentaho/WEB-INF/lib/mantle-3.6.0-stable.jar#uzip/org/pentaho/mantle/server

Use the following snippet:

num-startup-urls=1
startup-url-1=/pentaho/content/pentaho-cdf/RenderXCDF?solution=CST&path=%2F&action=cst.xcdf&template=mantle
startup-name-1=CST


Optionally, replace tomcat/webapps/pentaho/jsp/PUCLogin.jsp with the included
version.  If a user has a single fullScreen tab configured, they will be
redirected directly from the login screen, bypassing the PUC screen.
